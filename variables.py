#When we solve an equation 2x=10 in math class, we call x a variable with an unknown value. 
#We willl use variables slightly differently in python, we will declare them with a value immediatley
#such that:

x = 5

#Notice that that code did not have a '#' before it, having '#' before a piece of code denotes a comment.
#A comment is code that is not treated as code by your computer. Feel free to write anything in a comment.
#but keep it SFW, you dont want to hurt your computer's feelings. They are sensitive, lmao. 

#We can reasign a value to x by redeclaring the variable

x = 7
