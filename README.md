# Haddon-Township-Programming-Club-Documents

I highly recommend familiarizing yourselves with the python programming language, even if you are already taking a class which teaches another. Swift is only applicable to apple devices, and html/css are not turing complete. Python--relative to other languages--is easy to learn due to it's english-like syntax and high level design principles. 

Over the first few meetings we will go over some of the basics of computer science. These topics include Abstraction, Architecture, Basic Boolean Algebra, and Object-Oriented Design. I will also facilitate discussions of the profitability and lucrative nature of programming as a career. Having a firm grasp on these topics will make college level computing courses much easier. 

When it comes to learning how to program, a common mistake people make is learning how to program. What I mean by that is we focus on the easy stuff. We focus on learning syntax rules and all that stuff, which we can easily just learn when we have to. What we SHOULD focus on are conceptual principles, which can be applied to any langyage or tech-stack. DONT WORRY, youll still learn how to code, youll just learn theory as well. 

Soon after we have all acquired a basic understanding of the fundamentals, we will begin work on projects together. The goal of these projects is twofold, they should allow the members of the club to gain new understanding of a branch of computer science/software engineering and they should also have some end goal of profitability.

All profits from projects will be donated to a charity as decided by a popular vote AFTER expenses are reimbursed.

TECHNOLOGIES WE WILL USE (tbd):
- Python,
- Flask,
- HTML,
- CSS,
- C (potentially),
- SQLite3,
- MySQL,
- AWS(if necessary), 
-  and Github (the service you are reading this document on).

ROLES(tbd):
- Back-end programmer: Engineers the logic and servers behind a product
- Front-end programmer: Engineers the side users interact with when using an application
- Data Specialist: Uses SQL to store data effectively and efficiently for use in later analysis
- Site-Reliability Engineer: Ensures that the servers applications run on run smoothly
- Project Manager: directs the entire production (MUST HAVE AT LEAST SOME EXPERTISE IN ALL TECHNOLOGIES USED IN PROJECT)

RESOURCES:
- py4e.com greate website to learn python on.
- 15-110 This was a class at Carnegie Mellon University I took last summer. I bought notes off my old classmates so that I could use them here. The Professor who wrote them, Norman Bier, does cutting edge research in EdTech and knows his stuff. I will provide them in this repository.
- Udemy (POTENTIAL) Once we are profitable as a club and can cover expenses, a Udemy subscription for the club would allow us to buy courses taught by experts in a whole host of technologies. 
- w3 schools This is a site with tutorials for just about everything udner the sun, if you're stuck, go here first.
- Stack Overflow: at this level in your Software Engineering journey, every problem you will encounter has ben solved before. Stack Overflow is a forum site with an incredibly large database of common errors in code. It is so large, in fact, that there are jokes about the fact that stack overflow was somehow made without the help of stack overflow.
